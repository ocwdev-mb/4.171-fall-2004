"As a growing population we could greatly benefit from looking beyond the obvious spatial boundaries and into the more ambiguous areas of the semi-public and the visual. We tend to be spatially acquisitive and feel comfortable behind the definite boundary of our white picket fence. The question exists: can we ever look at space as a shared entity? And on the topic of non-physical space, could we ever embrace the idea of the visual as a public right and benefit to a point where it is preserved and on some occasions designed?"
